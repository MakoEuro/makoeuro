# ❤️ About me
Hi there! My name is Mako, and I'm a beginner software developer who started learning and really getting into
coding back at the start of high school in 2017. Since then I've gained a lot of interested in coding and learning
the depths of computers.

I'm studying to become a professional software developer at [MITT](https://mitt.ca/)

- My primary interest has always been computers as I'm adept at technology and problem solving. This also applies to my
hobby/side job of *DJing*. I make remixes for a company and for entertainment.

Always looking for new people to meet, so why not reach out?
