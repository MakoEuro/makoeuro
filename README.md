# About me
Hi there! My name is Mako, and I'm a beginner software developer who started learning and really getting into
coding back at the start of high school in 2017. Since then I've gained a lot of interested in coding and learning
the depths of computers.

My primary interest has always been computers as I'm adept at technology and problem solving. This also applies to my
hobby/side job of DJing. I make remixes for a company and for entertainment.

Always looking for new people to meet, so why not reach out?
